Snake is a classic arcade-style game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each bite.

## About
I created a React-based Snake game using HTML, SCSS and Javascript. The game includes features such as the ability to save high scores in Local storage, select different themes, choose different difficulty levels, and change the map size.

The game was adapted for different screen sizes. I used a "responsive design" approach to ensure that the game is displayed correctly on various devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
